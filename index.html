            <span id="para-1">Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for 
                embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled 
                bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.<br><br>
                Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its speed, portability, extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.<br><br>
                Lua is commonly described as a "multi-paradigm" language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with metatables. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes, and other related features using its single table implementation; first-class functions allow the employment of many techniques from functional programming; and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege.<br><br>
                Lua is a dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension or scripting language and is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as boolean values, numbers (double-precision floating point and 64-bit integers by default), and strings. Typical data structures such as arrays, sets, lists, and records can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous associative array.

            <h1 class="headings" id="heading-3">Why you should learn it</h1>
            <span id="para-3">Lua is definitely a very good language to learn. it helps adding addons to software, games, and much more. It allows for a much richer experience, because even if you are not a programmer, it can help in making addons for all of your favorite games, most games have a totally different experience with addons (especially the sandbox genre). It can also be useful to learn it because its a particularly easy language to learn, so you can get a taste of programming by a language which does not have a steep learning curve like others.<br><br>
                Learning Lua can also be useful to expand its community, which isn't as big as most other languages. I believe that since it is a language worth learning, it should definitely have a bigger audience. I want Lua to be one of the languages alongside Java, Python, and C++. Once you learn it, make sure to answer the questions related to Lua on Stack Overflow !<br><br>
                Have you heard/used nginx? You can use mini Lua scripts inside of nginx with the openresty setup. This would allow you to do things like dynamically assign SSL certs through Let's Encrypt to different domains. Use Apahce instead of nginx? Lua still has you covered.<br><br>
                Because Lua is fun to write! If you don't know it, it wouldn't hurt to learn a new language. If you already know how to program, picking up lua should be pretty quick. Read over something called 15 minutes of Lua, and you will have a decent understanding of the syntax. At that point it's just a matter of digging in!<br><br>

                I, the creator of this website, do not own Lua. Most of the information and images are taken from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br><br>
                This website is made to inform people about Lua and why they should learn it. <span>This is definitely not propaganda 
                made by the creators of Lua</span>.
